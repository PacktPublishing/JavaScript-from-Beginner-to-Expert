Hello my friend,

When you are learning something new do you ask yourself many questions like: Why do we need events? why do we need loops? What are they? How do we use them? and so on and so on?
If yes then you are in the right place because I will answer you all your questions looking like that. I will explain you in this course everything from basics to advanced components of the JavaScript so you can become the Expert.

This course is divided in 23 sections and it consists of 85 lessons. It has over 12 hours of great content.

You also gonna find here lots of quizzes and exercises. I will explain you syntax of the JavaScript and we will train this syntax during practical examples.

JavaScript is giving your website additional functionalities that can be executed on the user computer without re-connecting to the server. This allows you to do things that you cannot do with only HTML. Because of it the user interface becomes more friendly and more inter-active.

By inter-active elements I mean things like:

tooltips
animated image sliders
forms with pre-validation
slided panels
galleries with thumbnails
and many more

I give you 100% satisfaction which means that if you do not like my course you can request a refund up to 30 days time without any questions ask.
